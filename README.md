Summer Practice Plan: Realization & Implementation of LLM in Business Process

## Objective:
The objective of this summer practice is to explore the application of Language Model (LLM) in the context of business processes. The primary focus will be on realizing and implementing an LLM pipeline for a specific task, while ensuring data privacy through anonymization techniques. The following steps outline the plan for this summer practice:

## Research Close Themes:
1. Conduct a comprehensive literature review on language models and their applications in business processes.
2. Explore relevant research papers, case studies, and industry reports to gain insights into successful implementations.
3. Identify potential use cases and challenges specific to the chosen theme.

## Realization Pipeline Preparation & Encoding Data:

Define the specific task within the business process that the LLM will address.
Prepare the data required for training and evaluation, ensuring it aligns with the chosen theme.
Preprocess and encode the data, considering appropriate data representation techniques for the task at hand.
Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Use Anonymization Techniques for Input Data:
Investigate various techniques for anonymizing sensitive or private information within the input data.
Implement the chosen anonymization techniques to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the data.
Validate the effectiveness of the anonymization techniques through appropriate evaluation measures.

## Deploy and Fine-Tuning Model to Task:

Select a suitable language model architecture based on the task requirements and available resources.
Train the chosen language model on the prepared and anonymized data.
Fine-tune the model using appropriate techniques to optimize its performance for the specific task.
Evaluate the model's performance using established metrics and benchmarks.
